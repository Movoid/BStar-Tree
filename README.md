# A B\*-Tree implementation.

This is a simple, educational B\*-Tree implementation based on B+-Tree, not B-Tree.  
C-style, not STL.

- [x] `insert` with preemptive split
- [x] `erase` with preemptive merge
- [x] Duplicate keys support
- [x] `find`
- [x] Range query
- [ ] Cpp-style

Not cache optimized.

> `find` operation has poor performance.
